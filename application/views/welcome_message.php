		<p>This is the basic framework that CodeIgnighter provides developers with. I'm currently having a read of the dev guides to see if there is anything else that needs setting up, but my intial reaction would be a no. This is it, we just need to start messing around with routes and adding our Views, Models etc. to make it ours.</p>
		<p>Code subject to change, obviously.</p>
		<p>If people are interested, there is a short tutorial available on the CodeIgnighter wesbite that explains the basics of a how a framework like this works, including explainations on how the different parts communicate. You can find that <a href="http://ellislab.com/codeigniter%20/user-guide/tutorial/index.html">Here</a> if you're interested.</p>
